/**
 * The same strings for the English-medium half of a Dhaka coaching centre.

 * a compile error, an extra key here is a compile error, and a count-dependent
 * string whose signature drifts is a compile error. There is no runtime fallback
 * to Bangla — a fallback would turn all three into something only a teacher
 * standing in front of a class notices.
 *
 * Written as the English a Bangladeshi teacher writes, not as a dictionary
 * gloss. "Guardian" rather than "parent", because that is the word on every form
 * in the country and the one the schema uses. "Batch" is left alone for the same
 * reason — it is what a coaching centre calls a class group, and "section" or
 * "group" would be a translation of the word rather than of the thing.
