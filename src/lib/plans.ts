/**
 * Plan limits — the single source of truth for what each tier may do.
 *
 * The free teacher tier is a deliberate Trojan horse, not a crippled demo: one
 * batch, but every feature works. A teacher who can only take attendance never
 * discovers what the product does, and teachers are how we reach centre owners.
 * The cap is on scale, never on capability.
 *
 * SMS is the one hard cost we carry (~৳0.30-0.60 per 70-char Bangla segment),
 * so it is metered on every tier and never bundled generously.
